This is the official project of group C3.029, composed of five students from the Software 
Engineering degree at the University of Seville. This project represents the most significant 
part of the final grade in the third-year subject DP2, requiring the application of key 
concepts and methodologies learned throughout the course. Our goal is to deliver a high-quality 
solution that demonstrates our technical skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities.
