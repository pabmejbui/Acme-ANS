During the project, in order to maintain organization, GitHub provides labels that can be assigned to issues or pull requests.
By default, GitHub offers the following labels: bug, documentation, duplicate, enhancement, and good first issue.

These are sufficient to maintain good order, but due to the large number of tasks, we decided to create various labels to further 
categorize issues into more specific groups. These are the following:

- *deprecated issue*: Label for issues that were not completed during their corresponding deliverable and are now obsolete or unused. 
Its use is recommended to avoid duplicate issues in future deliverables.

- *group*: Label for issues corresponding to group tasks.

- *individual*: Label for issues corresponding to individual tasks.

- *mandatory*: Label for issues corresponding to mandatory tasks.

- *supplementary-I*: Label for issues corresponding to supplementary tasks.

- *supplementary-II*: Label for issues corresponding to second-phase supplementary tasks.

- *testing*: Label for issues related to testing tasks (not test cases). By testing, we refer to review tasks for the work we carry out. Every created task should have a review task to ensure proper functionality.
